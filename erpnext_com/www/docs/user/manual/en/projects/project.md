# Project Management

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result.  It is temporary because it has a defined beginning and expected timeframe. 

In ERPNext, Project Management is Task driven. You can a create a Project and divide it into multiple and assignable Tasks.

### Managing Tasks

A project generally has a broader scope that would not be completely assigned to one individual. Projects are divided into multiple Tasks which can be assigned to an individual and easily tracked. 

Tasks can be created from within a Project directly or a [Task](/docs/user/manual/en/projects/tasks.html) can be created separately as well.

### Task Completion

You can also track % Completion of a Project using different methods.

  1. Task Completion
  2. Task Progress
  3. Task Weight

### Project Costing

The Project Costing section helps you track the time, expenses and purchases incurred against the project.

* The Total Cost is composed of the costing amount from timesheets, the total cost of expense claims and the total cost of purchase invoices created against this project.

* The Gross Margin is the difference between Total Billed Amount and the Total Cost Amount for this project.

### Gantt Chart

ERPNext gives you an illustrated view of tasks scheduled for that project in Gantt Chart View.

* To view Gantt chart against a project, go to the Task list and Apply filter on the Project.
